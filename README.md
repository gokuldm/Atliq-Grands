# Atliq-Grands

ðŸš€ Unveiling Insights with Power BI! ðŸ“Š
Hello LinkedIn community! ðŸ‘‹
I'm thrilled to present my latest project as a Data Analyst Intern at Unified Mentor Private Limited! Using the powerful features of Power BI, I've crafted an interactive dashboard that dives deep into Atliq Hotel Hospitality Analysis. It focuses on guest experiences and compares performance across various Atliq hotels in diverse cities. ðŸ“ˆâœ¨

But wait, there's more! Let me introduce you to a challenging and impactful problem statement from one of our case studies:

Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands, a renowned chain of five-star hotels across India, has been a leader in the hospitality industry for 20 years. Recently, due to strategic moves by competitors and suboptimal decision-making, Atliq Grands has faced declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment.

To reclaim their market dominance, the managing director of Atliq Grands has embraced "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic imperative. Despite lacking an in-house data analytics team, they partnered with a third-party service provider to extract insights from their rich historical data.

Case Study Highlights:


Key Metrics Cards: Revenue, Occupancy %, and Average Rating at a glance, enabling quick performance assessment.

Performance Variations Across Cities and Properties: Highlighting insights into regional performance disparities.

Granular Performance Trends: Weekly Trends, Occupancy by Day Type, and Booking Percentage by Platform, offering deep insights into customer behavior and operational patterns.

Through this enriching experience, I've honed my skills in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions and enhance business outcomes.

I'm passionate about leveraging data to weave compelling narratives and empower businesses like Atliq Grands to flourish in competitive markets.
